# Text Sentiment Analyzer Using Neural Network

This project implements a text sentiment analyzer in Python using a neural network. The model is designed to classify text into sentiments such as positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis is powered by three key libraries: `newspaper3k` for extracting articles, `nltk` for natural language processing, and `TextBlob` for text processing and sentiment analysis. To get started, install the required libraries and run the script to analyze the sentiment of any given text.
